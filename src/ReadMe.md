This Project has all the implementation of DataStructures.
I will try to implement as much as possible and try to give Space and Runtime Complexity of all operations.

1. Stack
	Using Array
	Using Node
	Operations:
		push
		pop
		peek (just display top element, do not remove)
		size (return number of elements in stack)
2. Queue
	Using Array [Fixed size]
	Using Node
	Operations:
		add 
			at first position
			at last position
			at given position (take position input from user)
		remove
			at first position
			at last position
			at given position (take position input from user)
		Display all elements of Queue
		Search given element and return true is exists.
		Update Given element value with new value
3. CircularQueue
	Using Array [Fixed size]
	Using Node
	Operations:
		add
		remove 
		search
		size
		display all elements
4. DoubblyLinkedList
	Operations:
		add
		remove
		search 
		size
		display all elements
5. Searching
	Linear search
	Binary Search
6. Sorting
	Given an unsorted list of an array, sort them using below methods and display sorted elements.
		Bubble Sort
		Selection Sort
		Insertion Sort
		Merge Sort
		Quick Sort
		Bucket Sort
		Heap Sort (after learning tree)
	Given a Queue of Nodes with random data, sort the queue and print sorted data traversing the queue.
7. Tree
	Create a normal Tree using Node
	Create a binary tree using Node
		Operations:
			Insert a node in tree
			Delete a node from a tree
			Search an element in tree
			Traverse a Tree using:
				BSF (recursive and non recursive if possible)
				DSF (recursive and non recursive if possible)		 
8. Graph
	Linear Graph
	Directed Graph
		Operations:
			Search an element in Graph
	Weighted Graph
		Find Shortest path from A->B using Dijkstra's
		Find Shortest path from A->B using Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree		
9. Heap 
	MinHeap
	MaxHeap
	Binary Heap
10. Trie datastructure
